    <h1>Power Plants in Oregon and Energy Sources</h1>
    <div id="map"></div>
    <p>The locations of Power Plants in Oregon represented by points, and the color of points representing the types of energy source used.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h1>The Major Energy Sources</h1>
    <div id="map2"></div>
    <p>With the rainy Oregon weather, there are not much large-scale solar farms.</p>
    <p>But there are many rivers flowing within the state and dams to avoid floods that could be caused due to the rain sre important, allowing multiple hydroelctric power plants to be placed.</p>
    <p>The greatest power producing sources (over 20 MW produced in each plant) in Oregon is hydro power, which is of course focused in areas close to rivers.</p>
    <p>All of the other power plants  seem to be placed in similar locations as the other power palnts with the same primary sources - such as the wind turbines. </p>
    <p>Location is a large limiting factor in Oregon in terms of energy. </p>
    <p><br>With this map, we can see the relationship between location and energy sources used for electricity generation, but it does not directly show the energy source used in Oregon. </p>
    <p>In 2020, the electricity consumed in Oregon derived mostly from hydropower (about 39%), but the next largest source is coal (about 27%). </p>
    <p>It makes sense that hydroenergy has the highest proportion based on the map, but as the map shows, there are no coal power plants in Oregon.</p>
    <p>Electricity generated by coal is imported from outside the state, making up a large part of the state's energy.</p>
    <p><br>Oregon would become fully carbon-free after they can generate their electricity completely from the "clean" or low emission sources, but it still seems to be a long path to go. <br></p>
