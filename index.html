    <h1>The Major Energy Sources</h1>
    <div id="map2"></div>
    <p>The greatest power producing sources (over 20 MW produced in each plant) in Oregon is hydro power, which is of course focused in areas close to rivers.</p>
    <p>Location is a large limiting factor in Oregon in terms of energy. </p>
    <p>There are not much suitable areas for solar production, but there are many rivers flowing within the state, allowing hydroelctric power plants to be placed.</p>
